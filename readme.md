# AO3 Bookmark Improver

Love scrolling through other people's bookmarks and using the handy button right there to bookmark them for later? Get annoyed by how when you make a new bookmark, it takes you to a dedicated new bookmark page (useless) and when you hit the back button, you're scrolled past your previous position because of how long the bookmark form is AND you can't tell where that position is because the buttons haven't updated to say "Saved"? Well, worry no more!

The AO3 bookmark improver adds a "Save" button to _every_ page with a listing of works. Bookmark things without leaving the comfort of a search or works page! It also adds a back button to the new bookmarks page, so you can go back to exactly the spot you were on in the previous page, with the buttons updated to "Saved" for any works you've bookmarked.
